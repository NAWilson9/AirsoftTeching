    Ok, A little bit of informative raging here on battery info. It is kept relatively simple but it should be sufficient for most people.
</p>
<p>
    Nimh batteries come in different sizes and capacities. Each cell of a nimh pack is equal to 1.2v. So, a 8.4v pack has 7 cells in series. Series adds voltage, parallel adds capacity and amperage. There are different specifications for the physical sizes of each cell. The most popular ones in airsoft are 2/3A and Sub C. 2/3A are know as "mini" or "small type" where as Sub C is know as "large type." NiMH packs have the advantage of being much more chemically stable.
</p>
<p>
    Lipos are different. Each lipo cell is 3.7v. So a 7.4v lipo has 2 cells in series, 11.1v lipos have 3 cells in series, etc. If you notice, lipos are talked about as 2s or 3s. The "s" in there refers to series as mentioned above. A 2s lipo is the same as 2 cell lipo. There really aren't any set size specifications with lipos so a bit of measuring is in order to make sure they fit. Lipo's have the benefits of being lighter, output more amps, have less voltage droop, are generally cheaper, and maintain a majority of their power until they are discharged compared to NiMH packs progressively getting weaker until dead.
</p>
<p>
    There are two main things to look for (three for lipos) when buying a battery.
    1. Voltage - Voltage will generally determine how many RPM's your motor is spinning. The more volts, the higher the rof you will get. Voltage also has an effect on trigger response. The higher the voltage, the faster the motor will be able to spin up. Think of voltage as horsepower.
</p>
<p>
    2. Capacity - Measured in miliamp hours, the more MAH you have, the more shots you will get per charge. Say you have a battery that is 1200MAH. That battery could discharge at 1200 milliamps for an hour before it's dead. This means if it's being discharged at 2400 milliamps, it will last 30 minutes. You can extrapolate that further if you so desired.
</p>
<p>
    3. Discharge rate (for lipos) - Discharge rate is a measurement that specifies the amount of amps the battery can put out for a certain amount of time. This is measured in C. 1C is equal to the capacity of the pack in amps(to go from MAH, divide by 1000), multiplied by 1. So, if you have a pack with a capacity of 2500mah, 1C is 2.5 amps (2500/1000)*1 = 2.5). Now that you know how C works, what does the C rating on your pack mean? Well most of the advertised C ratings is the maximum amount of power the pack can sustain until it is completely drained. This is known as the "constant" C rating. So if you have a 2500mah pack, with a C rating of 60C you would get 150amps. That pack can put out 150amps continuously until it is dead. There are also burst specifications which is usually the max power over a 15 or 30 second period. Now this is the part that annoys the heck out of me. "Oh yea man, my 2134513463C lipo is so powerfull." The C rating alone doesn't mean anything. Here's an example. We'll use a 40C 1500mah lipo and a 20c 5000mah lipo as examples. Doing our math, the 1500 can put out 60 amps continuously. Our "weak" 20c 5000 can put out 100 amps continuously. That is quite a bit more than that "powerful" 40c 1500.
</p>
<p>
    Knowing how C ratings work is all fine and good but what does amps get you for your AEG? Think of amps as the torque it has. Your motor will reach peak rpm sooner and will have more power to overcome all of the resistance in your gearbox. Increasing this can give you a rof boost, assuming the battery you were previously using is incapable of supplying sufficient amps to your motor. Any rof boost from this will generally be smaller than a boost from increasing voltage.
</p>
<p>
    Now, for some more advanced stuff. Has anyone wondered why a 7.4v lipo performs about the same as a 9.6v nimh pack? Well it has to do with voltage drop under load. With your nimh pack, when you pull the trigger, the motor requires a certain amount of amps to function properly. Your nimh pack, usually, can't provide the full amount of amps. So what does it do? It lowers the voltage in order to increase the amount of amps it can put out. This works because of this formula: Watts = volts * amps. So, if the voltage goes down, the amps have to go up to get the same amount of watts. NIMH packs put out a very small amount of amps compared to lipos. So, because the lipos can put out many more amps, the voltage drop under load is far less and thus under load, the voltage of a 7.4v lipo and a 9.6v nimh are similar.
</p>
<p>
    If you think further, you would wonder why that 9.6v nimh conveniently drops to around 7.4v. The answer is that our AEG's are only pulling enough amps to only need the 9.6v pack to drop that far. If our AEG's pulled 100amps, the voltage drop of the 9.6v would be far greater. But, with (stock) AEG's only pulling 15-20 or so amps, the 9.6v is similar to a 7.4v lipo. Another random tidbit of information, just because you're lipo can put out 5262835762456 amps, doesn't mean that it will be used. If your motor can only draw 40 amps, then that's all that will be used. This is why despite your lipo putting out 100 or more amps, your 25a or 28a fuse won't blow. The amount of amps being used is only what the motor can draw.
</p>
<p>
    Anyways, if you know all of this, you should be more than ready to pick a lipo or nimh pack. Let me know if there are any typos or errors or anything and I will revise it. Also, feel free to ask any questions.

    Part 2: Battery Care
</p>
<p>
    This part of the "guide" will be divided into two sections, one for NiCd and NIMH batteries, and one for Lipos.
</p>
<p>
    Charging:
</p>
<p>
    So you got your nice NiMH battery and you're ready to charge it. If you have a NiCD battery, these same steps apply, but please, dispose of it and get a proper NiMH battery. There are two types of charges you'll run into. A "smart" charger, and the piece of junk charger that comes with your AEG. Here's the process you need to go through in order to charge your battery with the $3 "dumb" charger.
</p>
<p>
    1. You need to completely drain the battery. You can do this by simply shooting it in your AEG until it doesn't fire anymore. You do not want to just lay on the trigger until it's dead as you might wreck your motor. The best way to do this is to simply use it in a game until it's dead.
</p>
<p>
    2. You need to know how many amps the charger outputs. So say your charger outputs .5 Amps. This is equal to 500Mah and you can think of this as how much capacity it can fill in an hour. Then you need to divide the Mah of your pack by this number. So if you have a 1200Mah battery, you'll get 2.4, which means it will take 2.4 hours to completely charge your battery. This is why it is important that the battery be completely dead before you start charging it. What if the battery isn't dead and you charge it for the usual 2.4 hours? You'll over charge the battery and long story short, you'll lessen the amount of cycles you will get out of it. (Note, a cycle is one charge and discharge). The battery could even start to swell up and leak acid in a more extreme case (yes, it's happened to me.)
</p>
<p>
    Do you see how terrible of a system that is? Because of the nastyness I mentioned above, this is why you need a smart charger. A smart charger detects when the battery is full and then stops charging it. Convenient, right? You can start to charge the battery at any amount of capacity left and the charger will only charge it until it's full. Not only that, but smart chargers generally charge MUCH faster than the cheapo ones. So instead of taking 2.4 hours to charge that measely 1200Mah battery, it can take only 1 hour to charge a 5000Mah battery, assuming the charger outputs enough amps. The one thing you have to consider with smart chargers is how quickly you charge a pack. Nimh batterys should generally adhere to the 1C rule though you can get away with charging quicker at the expense of reducing the amount of cycles you'll get. I wouldn't go passed 1.5C. For determining what C is, look at Part 1 of this guide.
</p>
<p>
    For lipo's, it's basically the same thing as charging an NiMH on a smart charger. However, you MUST make sure the smart charger you're using is capable of charging lipos. Otherwise you basically plug it in and hit go. Depending on the charger, you'll want to make set the charge current to what you want. 1C used to be the max charging limit but now 5C is pretty common with even higher amounts possible. Always check the specs on your battery.
</p>
<p>
    There is an additional step that needs to be taken with lipos. As mentioned previously, a single battery is basically always made up of multiple cells. Through the normal charging and discharging of a pack, the voltage of each cell in a lipo pack starts to fluctuate. So one cell can be a tad bit higher voltage than the others. Over time, that cell could be excessively higher than the others and so you might end up over charging it. If the lipo charger you're using is detecting the voltage of the pack overall and charging evenly to all the cells, then that one cell that is slightly higher will become over charged and could swell up and basically explode. Similarly, if there's a single cell that is less charged than the others, then it's voltage could drop to an unsafe level. The solution to this problem is to either balance charge your packs or use a standalone balancer ocasionally. Most chargers will have a built in balance port that you connect the packs balance port to and it will either charge through the port or will monitor the voltage of each cell and adjust accordingly. If you use a standalone balancer, you connect the balance tab to the balancer and it will either charge or discharge each cell until they are the same voltage (capacity).
